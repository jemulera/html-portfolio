<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student at ASU studying computer science. I am taking a summer class on web development and this is the porfolio
for the first few dys of the course. Hope you like it!

<p>The Death Star will be compconsted on schedule. We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless. If they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side.

  From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance and the end of your insignificant rebellion. Give into your hate and anger General Kenobi. You are a bold one. Kill him! Nothing will stand in our way. I will finish what you started. Forgive me. I feel it again... the call from light.</p>

<p>I am the Senate. I will fulfill our Destiny The time has come. Execute Order 66. Search your feelings; you know it to be true! Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test. Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed; I cannot be beaten. I see his mind; I see his every intent. Yes... I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!

  Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true. He could destroy us. When I left you I was but the learner. Now I am the master. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. Army or not, you must realize, you are doomed.</p>
